# ldns (Local DNS)

If you're a developer, and you manage multiple vhosts(Virtual Hosts) on your local machine. It can sometimes be a pain figuring out which host record is active locally, and also toggling between active/inactive states of the hosts records, as these operations require that you deal with the hosts file directly. 

LDNS gives you a clean CLI to manage local host records, and more.
